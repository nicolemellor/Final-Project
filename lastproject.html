    	    the United States after completing her Ph.D. in physical chemistry. From 1939 to 1953 she was 
    	    involved in solar energy research at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/" >the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. Maria is known
    	     for creating the first thermoelectric power generator in 1947. Telkes is also known for designing
    	    the first solar heating system for the Dover Sun House in Dover, and the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling" > thermoelectric refrigerator</a>
    	     in 1953 using the principles of semiconductor thermoelectricity. Maria was an amazing
    	     inventor of practical thermal devices, including a miniature 
    	     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-powered_desalination_unit"> desalination unit </a> for 
    	     use on lifeboats, which used solar power and condensation to collect potable solar still. This still 
    	     saved the lives of airmen and sailors who would have been without water when abandoned at sea. Telkes 
    	     is considered one of the founders of solar thermal storage systems, which her the nickname "the Sun Queen". 
    	     She moved to Texas in the 1970s and was involved with many different solar start up companies.</p>
